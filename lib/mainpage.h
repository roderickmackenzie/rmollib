* @section intro Introduction
* This is the main web based documentation to the rmollib library.  The rmollib library provides all the main functions needed for manipulating molecules stored in the pdb, gro and pdbz format.  A pdf copy of this documentation can be downloaded <a href="./latex/refman.pdf">here</a>.  The library is split into four main parts.  The vector library (vec), used to manipulate vectors.  The molecule library (mol) used to manipulate molecules.  The System library used to manipulate systems of molecules and finally the film library used to access pdb files containing multiple time frames.  By these separate library one can conveniently manipulate atoms, molecules or collections of molecules in any way desired.
